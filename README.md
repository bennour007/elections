# elections

This project aims to create a map for voting systems on the current political spectrum in Tunisia.
I started by scrapping, cleaning, and organizing data of the 2014 general elections.


The next steps are about simulating different elections senarios in order to analyze scientifically the effect of different voting systems on the parliamentary blocks,  over which I will be building a political stability index based on the initial blocks of parliament and the rate of churn of MPs from their block and it's effect on the stability of the governement.


That is in simple words modeling the effect of different elections law, "political tourism", over the stability of the government and the majority in the parliament.


This will also open interesting research on the efficiency of voting systems in Tunisa, and what combination should we choose in order to have a majority and preserve the minority under the dome of Bardo.
